# phev2mqtt-nxt

Connects a Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (or Eclipse Cross PHEV) to MQTT and Home Assistant,
over the car's own WiFi. A fork of [buxtronix/phev2mqtt](https://github.com/buxtronix/phev2mqtt).

## What it does

 * Shows the battery, charging, plug, doors, locks, lights and climate in Home Assistant
   (or anything else that speaks MQTT)
 * Pre-heats or cools the car, switches the lights and cancels the charge timer
 * Tells you whether the car is connected, how strong its WiFi is, and when it last
   connected
 * Has a web interface for the status, the controls, the setup and the log

Tested on an Outlander PHEV MY14 and MY18 and an Eclipse Cross (2022).

## Install

On a Raspberry Pi (any model) or another machine with Debian, Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS,
and a WiFi adapter within reach of the car:

```
version=0.5.0
deb=phev2mqtt_${version}_$(dpkg --print-architecture).deb
base=https://github.com/athomasse/phev2mqtt-nxt/releases/download/v$version
curl -fLO "$base/SHA256SUMS" -fLO "$base/$deb"
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
sudo apt install "./$deb"
```

Turn on the web interface in `/etc/phev2mqtt/config.yaml` (`sudoedit` it):

```
web_listen: ":8080"
web_password: "something long"
```

Then start phev2mqtt and open `http://<machine>:8080` (any user name, that password):

```
sudo systemctl enable --now phev2mqtt
```

## Configure

In the web interface:

1. **Car WiFi**: the car's network (*REMOTExxxxxx*) and its password, which come with the
   car. This needs NetworkManager; without it, see the examples in
   `/usr/share/doc/phev2mqtt/examples/`.
2. **MQTT**: your broker, e.g. `tcp://192.168.1.10:1883`, with its user name and
   password.
3. Optionally the car's **name in Home Assistant**.

Then register with the car, once. Put the car into registration mode ("Setup Your
Vehicle" in the
[Mitsubishi instructions](https://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/en/products/outlander_phev/app/remote/)),
and within 5 minutes run:

```
sudo systemctl stop phev2mqtt
phev2mqtt client register
sudo systemctl start phev2mqtt
```

The car talks to one client at a time, so keep the Mitsubishi app disconnected. If the
WiFi refuses the password, check letters that look alike, like `l`, `I` and `1`.

All settings, with comments, are in `/etc/phev2mqtt/config.yaml`; the log is in
`journalctl -u phev2mqtt` and in the web interface.

## Home Assistant

The car shows up as a device by itself, through MQTT discovery, once phev2mqtt has
connected to it: search for "phev" in your entities.
